# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository is designed for production-quality AI/ML/quant research systems.

All coding agents must optimize for:

- maintainability
- modularity
- reproducibility
- testability
- documentation quality
- scientific rigor
- future extensibility

The repository should always be maintainable by another engineer without requiring tribal knowledge.

# Core Engineering Rules

## Architecture

All projects must follow modular separation.

```text
project/
├── ingestion/
├── preprocessing/
├── modeling/
├── evaluation/
├── api/
├── infra/
├── notebooks/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── README.md
├── REPORT.md
└── AGENTS.md
```

Rules:

- Keep modules isolated
- Use explicit interfaces
- Avoid large monolithic scripts
- Separate experimental notebooks from production code
- Move reusable notebook logic into Python modules

---

# Code Quality Rules

## Mandatory Type Safety

- Use type hints everywhere
- Functions must have explicit return types

## Documentation

- All functions require docstrings
- Public classes require usage examples

## Formatting

Code must remain compatible with:

- ruff
- mypy
- pytest

---

# Testing Rules

After every meaningful code change:

```bash
pytest
```

For linting:

```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
```

Pre-commit hooks must automatically run:

- tests
- lint checks
- formatting checks

---

# Security Rules

- Never expose secrets
- Never commit credentials
- Never expose API keys
- Use environment variables
- Use `.env.example`

---

# README.md Requirements

README.md must function as a complete technical wiki.

It must always include:

- project overview
- architecture diagram
- installation guide
- dependency setup
- module explanations
- execution workflow
- testing instructions
- deployment instructions
- known limitations
- future improvements

Use nested sections.

Use ASCII diagrams where helpful.

Example:

```text
PDF -> Parser -> Chunker -> Embeddings -> Vector DB -> Retrieval -> LLM
```

README must always remain updated after major architectural changes.

---

# REPORT.md Requirements (MANDATORY FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS)

Every research-heavy repository must maintain an additional `REPORT.md`.

This file represents the scientific paper / empirical research report.

Agents must automatically update REPORT.md whenever:

- experiments change
- model architecture changes
- evaluation metrics change
- datasets change
- new findings emerge

---

# REPORT.md Required Structure

## 1. Title

Must be precise and academic.

Bad:

"Cool AI Trading Model"

Good:

"Hidden Markov Regime Detection in Bitcoin Markets Using Deribit Microstructure Features"

---

## 2. Abstract (150–300 words)

Must contain:

- problem statement
- methodology
- dataset
- findings
- contribution

Must be exactly one concise section.

---

## 3. Introduction

Must contain:

### Paragraph 1
Problem motivation

### Paragraph 2
Current limitations

### Paragraph 3
Proposed approach

### Paragraph 4
Research contributions

Example contributions:

- We propose...
- We evaluate...
- We demonstrate...

---

## 4. Literature Review

Must cite prior research.

Examples:

- Engle (1982)
- Bollerslev (1986)
- Hamilton (1989)

Agents must avoid shallow citation dumping.

They must synthesize literature.

---

## 5. Dataset Section

Must contain:

- source
- sample period
- number of observations
- variable descriptions
- cleaning methodology
- train/test split

---

## 6. Methodology Section

Must contain:

- mathematical formulas
- algorithm design
- optimization logic
- feature engineering pipeline

For ML/quant systems:

- objective functions
- loss functions
- model assumptions

---

# Results Section Rules

This is mandatory.

---

## Descriptive Statistics Table

Must include:

| Variable | Mean | Std | Min | Max |

---

## Model Comparison Table

Examples:

| Model | Accuracy | Sharpe | AUC | RMSE |

---

## Robustness Table

Alternative configurations must be tested.

---

# Mandatory Figures

Research papers must contain:

Minimum:

3 figures

Preferred:

5–10 figures

Examples:

- correlation heatmap
- feature importance chart
- confusion matrix
- regime plot
- transition matrix
- posterior probability plot
- residual diagnostics
- model comparison chart

---

# Figure Rules

Every figure must contain:

1. Figure number
2. Figure title
3. In-text reference
4. Interpretation paragraph

Bad:

Insert chart without explanation.

Good:

"Figure 4 shows regime persistence across volatility clusters."

---

# Citation Rules

Portfolio paper:

10–30 citations

Academic thesis:

30–100 citations

Conference paper:

15–50 citations

Agents must cite:

- datasets
- prior methods
- academic foundations
- benchmarks

---

# Discussion Section

Must explain:

- business implications
- limitations
- model weaknesses
- assumptions

---

# Conclusion Section

Must summarize:

- contribution
- findings
- future work

---

# Appendix Rules

Move excessive plots/tables to appendix.

Appendix may contain:

- additional experiments
- hyperparameter sensitivity
- supplementary visualizations

---

# Reproducibility Rules

All experiments must be reproducible.

Agents must preserve:

- random seeds
- experiment configs
- dataset versions
- model configs

Use:

- MLflow
- config files
- experiment tracking

---

# Notebook Rules

Notebooks are allowed only for:

- exploration
- visualization
- prototyping

Final logic must move into production modules.

---

# Pull Request Rules

Agents must:

- keep PRs small
- add tests
- update README
- update REPORT
- document architectural changes

---

# Failure Conditions

Agents must NEVER:

- create giant scripts

---

# Final Goal

The repository should always be:

- production-grade for engineers
- reproducible for researchers
- understandable for recruiters
- extensible for future agents

The repository should function simultaneously as:

- software product
- research artifact
- portfolio asset
